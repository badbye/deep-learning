deep-learning
=============

This repository is created to save my programming exercises in **deep learning**.

All the reading materials I use are accessible at [UFLDL Tutorial](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial). Fresh learners from China can also read the [Chinese version](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B).
